I had to literally ask for every basic thing one by one... No tissues, no spoon, no fork at table. Even when i asked for a finger bowl, they first said they don't provide it. But when another family asked for it, they gave it to them. When i mentioned the same that the other family got it, they gave me a finger bowl with cold water.\nHygiene: While having my food, one guy is sweeping in front of my table. Sweeping in an AC room while others are having dinner, No common sense at all.",

The rates of dishes are almost the same as compared to other restaurants. The taste is also good. Nowadays they have restructured their interiors, due to which if you're coming with a group of more than 6 people then you'll be congested.\n\nEarlier around 10 people can sit easily but now if someone comes with more than 6 people then it makes them really uncomfortable. In my recent visit, manchurian served was not good. Paneer tikka, sweet corn, hara kabab is good.",

While the rooftop isn’t very spacious, it accommodates around 40-50 people, making it ideal for small gatherings.\n\nThe food left me with mixed feelings. The starters were excellent, bursting with flavor, and undoubtedly the highlight of the meal. However, the main course—vegetable dishes and dal—was just average and didn’t quite match the expectations set by the starters.\n\nThe biggest drawback, unfortunately, was the service. It was noticeably slow, and the staff seemed inattentive despite multiple requests. This aspect could use significant improvement.\n\nOn the brighter side, the rooftop vibe was enjoyable and made the evening pleasant despite the slow service.",

On the brighter side, the Hakka noodles were excellent.\n\nThe atmosphere remains as chill and peaceful as ever. The café is beautifully designed—its logo, window area, and overall interior are aesthetically pleasing and thoughtfully done.\n\nAlthough this visit didn’t quite match up to previous ones, I still believe this place is a must-visit. It’s an iconic spot in Ujjain, and almost every Ujjainite has been here at least once.",

Even before that, the cooling was poor. We had to call and complain to get it fixed, which disrupted our rest.\n\nWhat made things worse was the attitude of the staff. At checkout, no one acknowledged our inconvenience. The manager had no idea about the issue, and the front desk staff were indifferent—as if handling complaints with silence is part of their daily routine. Not even a basic apology was offered.\n\nWe checked in late (around 10 PM) and left after breakfast. All we wanted was a peaceful night’s sleep, but even that wasn’t delivered.

        "text": "I am writing to express my deep disappointment with my recent experience at this property (Rudraksh Resort Ujjain). Unfortunately, my stay was far from the standard one would expect from a hospitality establishment, especially one charging premium rates.\n\nMy experience began at the reception, where I arrived at approximately 10:30 PM, hoping to find a reasonable deal for a short stay—less than 12 hours, as I planned to check out the next morning. However, I was informed that the entire resort was sold out and that even if rooms were available, they would be charged at a non-negotiable rate of ₹8,000. I was also told that staff had been instructed to sell rooms at escalated prices. I found the tone and manner in which this was communicated quite unwelcoming and lacking the courtesy expected in the hospitality industry.\n\nSubsequently, I booked a room online through Cleartrip for ₹6,500—a Superior Room. Upon returning to the property, I was told the room I booked was not available and that I had been \"upgraded\" to a Superior Deluxe Room. While I initially appreciated the gesture, the upgraded room was in a poor and unacceptable condition—unclean and poorly maintained. I immediately requested to be placed in the room I originally booked.\n\nEventually, I was allotted the original category, but the room did not match the images shown online. It lacked basic amenities like bedside lamps and looked significantly different from the photos, which I was told \"may be outdated.\" It was clear to me, however, that the pictures online were recent and more flattering than the reality.\n\nI raised the issue again with a senior staff member, who then offered another upgrade to an Executive Room. By this time, it was around 11:15 PM, and I was extremely fatigued from the entire ordeal. The Executive Room, too, was disappointing. It appeared old and worn-out—the furniture was stained and had hair from a previous guest, the toilet was not properly cleaned, and overall cleanliness and quality of the room were far below acceptable standards. I have photographic evidence to support these claims.\n\nGiven the premium pricing, I strongly believe that basic standards of hygiene, maintenance, and service should be upheld. Unfortunately, that was not the case.\n\nLater that night, I visited their cafe, which I was informed operates until 2:00 AM. I ordered Hakka noodles and a classic veg pizza. The noodles were average, but the pizza—after a 20-minute wait—was served with an overwhelming amount of mozzarella cheese, making it inedible. When I requested to cancel the pizza, I was told it could not be canceled and could only be remade. At that point, given everything that had already transpired, I had no desire to wait another 20 minutes. After a prolonged and frustrating conversation involving multiple staff members, the item was eventually canceled.\n\nOverall, this was one of the worst hospitality experiences I have encountered. The quality of the rooms, lack of cleanliness, and dismissive customer service are not reflective of the standards expected from a resort of your repute. I would not recommend this property to others unless significant improvements are made in both quality and service delivery.",

This is Dharmshala and not resort.\n\nThe hotel was advertised as a 4-star property, but the reality was far from it like Dharmshala. The condition of the hotel was extremely poor—more comparable to a 1-star establishment. The rooms were inadequately maintained, unhygienic, and had a persistent foul smell. Basic amenities were missing:\nNo room service or in-house restaurant\nNo refrigerator in the room or anywhere on the property\nNo complimentary drinking water provided\nThe swimming pool was dirty.\nThe parking facility was inconveniently located 1 km away from the hotel\nAdditionally, the washrooms were unclean and the premises lacked regular housekeeping.\nThis experience was extremely disappointing and not aligned with what was promised at the time of booking.",

I specifically requested that my room be made ready by then and that my luggage be placed in the room, so that everything would be in order when I returned and there would be no inconvenience.\n\nWhen I came back at 12:15 AM, only one room was ready, and the second AC deluxe room was neither ready nor did anyone seem aware of it. The night staff said that the morning staff didn’t inform them, and in the morning, when I brought it up, I was told that the night staff should have handled it.\n\nSecondly, there was no tea/coffee maker in the room, even though it was mentioned as a facility in the AC deluxe room. The price difference between the two rooms was quite significant, but both rooms looked the same from the inside—so what was the benefit of paying more?\n\nIn the kitchen, there was only one staff member cooking and one steward delivering the food. The service was extremely slow. This place needs a lot of improvement so that such a beautiful property, located at such a prime location, can be utilized to its full potential.\n\nIt seems that because this is a government property, the staff is not paying proper attention to service and maintenance.",

They were polite, friendly, and went above and beyond to ensure my needs were met. A special shoutout to Sakshi, who was an absolute delight! She's an amazing listener and problem-solver, making sure every issue was resolved with a smile. Five stars isn't enough – I'd give it ten stars if I could! Highly recommend this hotel for its warm hospitality and excellent service.",

        "text": "My mother recently got admitted at Pushpa mission hospital in June 2025 month first in ICU and then in private room. The doctor Dr. Jayvardhan Varma is very good expert doctor. However, I have very bad experience with the most of the nurse staff(Private room) handling my mother case on day to day basis. Most of the nurses are either trainee or they simply dont have been taught how to talk or respond with respect. Following points shows their insensitivity:\n1. Whenever asked abt the patients BP value range being taken, they simply try to ignore first. Then being asked again, they still will not tell the range. Does the kin of patient dont have right to ask this basic info.to know the current status of patient health??\n2. They come to room and ask the kin of the patient to give the 4-5 different tablets at certain interval during the day..my straight forward question here is if mistakenly by fault the kin gives overdose of some tablet or forget to give one..who should be held responsible for this???\n3. Some of the nurse staff give arrogant (rude) answers & looks to any query being asked regarding the patient health in polite manner. If one is properly educated & in nursing profession then how one should respond to a polite question??? It was very frustating many a times for me to bear their rudeness...what if I could also have done the same in response to their rude answers leaving aside my politeness???? But I have kept patience till last...\n4. A nurse forgotten to give saline scheduled during the day time..so she literally came at midnight(12 pm)saying she has missed it during the day and now will put on the saline...How one can forget it???? Do patient has no right to sleep in night after so many doses, saline and injection during the day??\n5. When Saline are being put..ideally it is duty of nursing staff to come and check if the saline is complete or not( to avoid air or blood from veins getting up)...but all the time..myself have to monitor it and press the bell button which toobwas on extreme corner of room.\n6. The response time after pressing the bell was very slow..one has to press the bell button a couple of times for someone to come and attend the case when needed. Most of time, nurses were busy chit-chatting in their main room.\n7. The medicine prescribed by doctor or the bill to be paid for any test downatairs during the course of the day should be either given in one go or atleast a couple of times...it happened like I had to go downstairs at the billing or medicine section 4-5 times leaving behind the patient...who will take care of the patient if the kin is being told many times to go downstairs...why not only a couple of times????\n\nNursing profession is very caring and kind profession in which admitted patient is being treated very kindly. It is absolutely unacceptable if the caring staff displays rude gesture and talk like they are the bosses, even if they are confronting a polite individual. \"WHAT IS TRUTH REMAINS  A TRUTH \" and the god has seen that there..whatever I have said is what I have experienced, no doubt about it, even my review is not taken seriously. But ignoring it will simply malign the image of the hospital as this will happen again and again to someone in near future. The nursing staff must be given thorough training first and foremost on \"How to behave or respond in polite manner\".\nFew nurses were kind and polite in answering, but some seemed filled with arrogance & lack of mannerism.\nIts upto management of Pushpa mission to understand the gravity of situation. Ignore or respond and please take steps to train nurses to speak in polite kind way and not to throw their responsibilities on kin staying with the patient. My mother had been admitted to Room no. 219",

They do things on their own pace no matter what u say.\n\n- ICU ward is no better than a general ward.\n\n- Nurses, ward boys, on-call doctors and even the housekeeping staff thinks of themselves as some sort of royalty, extremely arrogant, slow, unprofessional behavior. Don't even know how to talk to patients or even to each other for that matter.\n\n- Ambulance driver will talk on phone while driving a patient and when u go complaining about it,the receptionist will say that it's fine they can receive calls while driving sometimes.\n\n- Cleanliness and hygiene is pathetic.",

Asked to hospital staff for the cameras to check . The biggest surprise, this hospital doesn't have security cameras at the entrance. So if anything happens at the entrance, hospital won't be liable bcz there will be no proof. So definitely going here is at own risk. Definitely I won't suggest this hospital and also they won't accept online payments at the reception. We have to go to there pharmacy pay online there nd thn they will give cash to u than that u hve to give to reception. Ridiculous working.",

I found the sign-boards explaining in detail all safety measures and duly posted.\nThe drivers of vehicles that came for regular refill had mixed opinions about service. One complained about lack of service personnel for refill while another nearby petrol pump had one person to every refuelling point. I found that there was a clean toilet and a schedule chart duly filled for cleaning it.\nA five star requires\n1. maintaining better cleanliness around refuelling points,\n2. serving with a smile\n3. manning the refuelling pumps adequately for prompt service.",

All below is my perspective as a master student.\nTalking about infrastructure it's painful to to see your college in such a poor and horrible condition. However after present principal Dr. Umesh Pendharkar took over charges to his position the college got a nice paint job but you can still find gaps between walls and columns at various classrooms. Many computers still runs on pirated window. Only in this year mid 2017 they manage to buy softwares like Ansys , Staad pro., etc while they are conducting M.E. in computer aided structural design and drafting for over 10 years. Lab for geotech and transportation is quite average you can manage to do all the practicals but can't say the same about structure lab. College placement for civil students is like a ghost, never heard of any company came for civil engineers but for other branches like cs, ec, elec and chem. they got fair nos. of companies. Faculties here are no doubt very knowledgeable, but they don't have time and their teaching method is also very poor if you compare it with the teaching method of renowned professors from IIT like Dr. Pradipta Banerjee. In my experience of three semesters of M.E. with 13 academic subjects, only in 1 subject we got our complete syllabus covered and that subject too is taught by a guest faculty Maheshvari Sir. And when you move to your dissertation in fourth sem you find that no professor has any useful knowledge regarding softwares other than Staad pro. and Autocad. And they don't support creative and innovative thought, in my case I have been assigned to a guide who is PhD in Geotech while I'm a structure student. This college is surely very poor choice for doing master degree. However for B.E. in civil it's still an O.K. choice.\n\nIf you take admission using GATE score then they will make you work for the department consultancy , yeah you read it right the civil department here also run consultancy and master degree students are made to do most of the jobs like concrete design and testing otherwise they won't approve your attendance thus make you disqualify for that month's GATE stipend.\n\nIn case you don't have much money to spend on education then this college is good because fees is pretty less.",

We used to have guest lectures by industry experts, as well as academicians from top intitutes like IIMs, XLRI and MDI.\n\nThe library had full compilations of HBR, literature by Peter Drucker and other management thoughtleaders. One never had to buy text books.\n\nAnd the beauty was, after the classes we used to gather at our professors' houses and kept discussing case studies and current news events.\n\nThat education gave me a solid foundation.\n\nAll our teachers from that time have soared high in the academic domain...Proud to say that we were taught by current VC of IGNOU, and a Director of IIM.",

Their expertise, patience, and dedication truly impressed me.\nNot only did I get my hair done here, but I also chose Monalisa beauty salon for all my pre-wedding and wedding looks, and I couldn't have made a better decision. From skincare treatments to bridal makeup and hairstyling, everything was handled with so much professionalism and care.\nThe staff was incredibly polite and welcoming, making sure I was comfortable at all times.\nWhat stood out the most was how they genuinely cared for me throughout the process.\nThey constantly checked in to see if I needed anything, whether it was water, a break, or even food when they noticed I hadn't eaten in a while. Their attention to detail and warm hospitality made the entire experience stress-free and enjoyable.\n\nIf you're looking for a salon that offers top-notch services with a personal touch, I highly recommend Monalisa beauty salon. They made my big day even more special, and I'm beyond grateful for their efforts. Definitely a 5-star experience!",

        "text": "Please consider 1 Star as Zero!\n\nI had an extremely disappointing experience with Original Electronics. They misguide their customers and provide the worst after-sales service imaginable. The staff is unhelpful and dismissive, and even worse, the owner seems completely uninterested in addressing any issues. It appears he’s letting his lower-level staff make all the decisions, which is ultimately ruining his reputation in the market.\n\nI strongly suggest avoiding this store and opting for online platforms instead, where you can do your own research and make an informed purchase. The staff at this store has the audacity to claim that negative Google reviews are fake, but they don’t have the courage to respond to them directly. I still have the invoice as proof of the poor experience I had, and once they’ve sold you the product, they couldn’t care less about your concerns. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this place if you value good customer service and honesty.",

From the moment I walked in, the staff were friendly, knowledgeable, and not at all pushy. They helped me find exactly what I needed and even gave great advice on how to match pieces with my home’s interior.\n\nThe quality of the furniture is outstanding—solid materials, beautiful finishes, and clearly built to last. Delivery was prompt, and the team assembled everything quickly and professionally. It’s rare to find such excellent service and craftsmanship these days.\n\nHighly recommend [Furniture Shop Name] to anyone looking for stylish, high-quality furniture with top-notch customer care. I’ll definitely be back for more!",

Manager delivered it on 30/11/24 and the next day my marriage but I didn’t have the time to inspect it . Manager (Mr Deepak) assured it that if anything is not up to the mark he will directly replace it . Problem came that the ply wood of the bed was bent but tha manager keeps ignoring it and denied for the replacement. Then I complaint the same to the Owner (Mr Satpal Saluja )but he also showed the careless behaviour and refused to accept the calls . I am facing this problem from past 3 months ,i have ordered approx 1.5 lakh items from RTD but still the value of customers is zero",

As soon as I stepped into the showroom, I was greeted by the warm and welcoming staff. The ambiance was elegant and sophisticated, perfectly reflecting the Tanishq brand.\n\nThe jewellery collection was stunning, with a wide range of designs to suit various tastes and preferences. From traditional to modern, the pieces were intricately crafted and showcased exceptional workmanship. I was particularly impressed by the 'Mia' collection, which featured beautiful, handcrafted pieces with a focus on comfort and wearability.\n\nWhat truly stood out, however, was the exceptional customer service. The staff was knowledgeable, patient, and helpful, taking the time to understand my preferences and making recommendations accordingly. They also offered me a complimentary cleaning and maintenance service for my purchase, which was a lovely touch.\n\nOverall, my experience at Tanishq Jewellery Showroom in Ujjain was outstanding. The combination of stunning jewellery, excellent customer service, and a welcoming ambiance makes it a must-visit destination for anyone looking for exquisite jewellery in Ujjain. I would highly recommend it to friends and family.\n\nRating: 5/5 stars",

While the Jalebi didn't quite hit the mark for me, the overall experience was good. Service could use a bit of improvement, particularly in terms of politeness and humility from the staff. However, since food taste is paramount, I'd give it 4 out of 5 stars. If you're coming from Ujjain Junction, take the exit from the back side (Platform 8) and it's about 2 km from there. Worth a visit for the delicious Poha and Samosa!\"",

They take bulk orders for Marriage gifting and parties. We are their daily consumer of Milk and various milk products since last 2.5 years and still continuing buying things due to their quality and freshness. The owners and workers are also very kind and humble to take care of their customers needs. They have now started selling Dahi Vada, Hot jalebi and Imarti. They also sell Kadhai Milk with saffron and dry fruits in the evening hours. People love to have their Kesar Hot Milk in the Winter nights for a feeling of warmth within. Highly recommended for Milk and Milk products in their area.",

They tell they have upgraded themselves so they want every customer recharge a smart card with minimum of 1.5k to 2k post which they will let you place order but to recharge the card they only accept CASH. Food they serve is horrible in taste. People taking order on counters are least bothered for customer service. Waiters consider themselves as the owner of the restaurant and they can make you change your table at any point of time and serve you someone’s order and they don’t accept serving wrong orders. People visiting Ujjain for the first time easily get fooled with such restaurants because of their name. Big NO!",

Don’t get confused if you see a sweet shop when entering as the restaurant is inside the sweet shop itself.\n\nGiving this place 4 stars only for the quality and taste of food. The service is very very unhurried, especially the guy who was serving food in the self service counter as you can see in my pictures. Man that uncongenial guy is totally unwelcoming as if he is doing a favour by serving us. Dude that’s your job. You have to continuously repeat your order till he makes it properly. If you order kachoris he won’t give you chutney, if you order poha he won’t guide you where the spoon is, if you order something else, he’ll not listen and pretend he didn’t hear. What a lazy bum.\n\nThen if you ask for a bill he’ll be like kaka ko aap hi items bata dena to bill ban jayega. That man just does not want to work. But all this hassle was easily overcome by the delicious kachoris, idli, and poha. They need to improve their dhoklas though. You just cannot leave this place without trying their warm delicious jalebis.\nThey have a limited menu for breakfast which is alright I guess, so please keep that in mind.",

The current state of their bread is disheartening, as it tends to break easily, making it challenging to enjoy as is or use for sandwiches. Even on the day of purchase, the bread lacks durability, and after just one day, it transforms into a collection of crumbs, leaving consumers with an unsatisfactory experience.\n\nDespite the bread concerns, the cakes at Bakers Lounge maintain their appeal, being both delicious and affordable. This positive aspect contrasts with the disappointing state of their bread. Moreover, the bakery's advantageous location adds to its overall attractiveness.\n\nTo enhance customer satisfaction, it may be beneficial for Bakers Lounge to address the issues surrounding the quality of their bread, ensuring that it aligns with the standard set by their other offerings. This constructive feedback aims to help the establishment maintain its reputation and keep customers returning for a more consistent and enjoyable experience.",

We drove 🚗 from Indore to Ujjain – a smooth 2-hour drive. Thankfully, we had already booked our entry tickets online 🎫. A helpful tip: make sure to carry a printout🖨️ of your entry pass, as mobile phones 📵 are not allowed inside the temple premises.\n\nThe darshan of the Jyotirlinga – the only south-facing Jyotirlinga – was a powerful and divine moment 🔥. It is believed that Lord Shiva manifested here as a pillar of fire, and standing there in the sanctum felt truly sacred 🙇‍♂️.\n\nAfter darshan, we took a walk through the temple corridor 🛕, which showcases beautiful stone statues 🗿 of Lord Shiva’s various incarnations. The whole area was clean, peaceful, and well-managed 👍.\n\nThere are proper arrangements to deposit your chappals/slippers 👡👞 near the temple entrance and clean drinking water 💧 is also available inside.\n\nHighly recommend every devotee of Lord Shiva 🕉️ to visit this sacred place at least once in their lifetime.\nHar Har Mahadev! 🙌🕉️",

        "text": "I recently visited this temple, what really caught my attention was the offering of liquor as prasad to the deity. 🤯\n\nThough there was a bit of a crowd but the waiting time was absolutely worth it. I also saw people tying sacred threads on the railings, praying for their wishes to come true.\n\nThe vibe was peaceful and the whole place felt spiritual.\n—————————-\nCurious to know more? Read below the full story 👇🏻\n\nWhere liquor is offered to deity as prasad, and no one knows where it goes!\n\nLocated on the banks of the river Shipra, in the middle of a Hindu cremation ground, Shree Kal Bhairav in Ujjain is a six-thousand-year-old temple. The temple is five kilometers away from the Mahakaleshwar Jyotirlinga. It is said that one’s visit to Ujjain is incomplete without a trip to this temple.\n\nSurprisingly, there are no dry days at the Kal Bhairav temple, as liquor is offered to the deity as prasad. The priest sitting in front of the deity pours liquor into a plate and places it near the deity's mouth while chanting mantras in Sanskrit and performing tantrik rituals. The plate is tilted slightly, and the liquid gradually begins to vanish. Within a couple of minutes, the god can consume as much as a quarter bottle, even though there is no visible opening in the deity’s mouth.\n\nThe liquor offered to the deity forms one of the five rituals of tantra – Madya (liquor), Mans (meat), Meen (fish), Mudra (gesture), and Maithun (copulation). Although several other deities across India receive alcohol as prasad, such as the Kali Mata temple in New Delhi and the Khabees Baba temple in Lucknow, only Kal Bhairav is supposed to possess the mysterious power of drinking liquor, and it remains a mystery where the liquid ends up.\n\nSeveral archaeologists and scientists have made multiple attempts to unveil this mystery. Even during the British period, the entire temple was excavated to determine if the liquid flowed into a cavity, but the mystery remained unresolved. Some claimed that the porous stone used to carve the deity could absorb alcohol, but this theory has been disproven. Others suggested that the alcohol evaporates into the atmosphere, but the rate at which the deity consumes the alcohol does not support this argument. Devotees believe that Lord Kaal Bhairav himself drinks the alcohol, and the prasad returned to the devotees is said to have healing powers that can cure various ailments.\n\nOutside the temple, liquor shops offer a variety of brands, where both men and women queue up to make their purchases. Hundreds of devotees visit the temple daily, some as pilgrims and others out of curiosity. The temple complex houses a Deepstambh adorned with oil lamps lit on special occasions.",

Had visited the temple on an auspicious weekend and the waiting queue was almost 1.5 hours but the crowd was very well managed and moved faster than expected. There are plenty of shops and 2 liquor stores outside this temple where you could buy the Aarati thali and other puja essentials.\n\nThe crazy part is there will be children selling water bottles by sitting on the dividers of the standing queue where you can buy water if you don’t have one!\n\nTip- If you’re visiting for the first time and in the day time, do carry a cap or dupatta to cover your head as it’s very sunny during the summers and you’ve to wait in a long queue if there’s rush.",

Located close to the famous Mahakaleshwar Temple, it is dedicated to Goddess Harsiddhi, an incarnation of Goddess Durga. The temple holds significant religious importance and is believed to be the spot where Goddess Sati’s elbow fell, making it a powerful spiritual site for devotees.\n\nThe architecture of the temple reflects the Maratha style, with its striking red tower (shikhara) and intricately carved structures. The presence of the Sri Yantra, symbolizing divine feminine energy, and an ancient well within the premises adds to its historical and mystical appeal. The temple is especially famous for its two majestic deepstambhas (lamp pillars), which are lit with hundreds of oil lamps during evening aarti, creating a divine and captivating ambiance.\n\nVisitors often describe the experience as spiritually uplifting, especially during Navratri when the temple is beautifully decorated and crowded with devotees. The temple is well-maintained, easily accessible, and offers a peaceful atmosphere despite its popularity. Whether you're a devotee or a traveler interested in cultural heritage, Harsiddhi Temple offers a memorable and soul-stirring experience.",

It is believed that the elbow of Goddess Sati fell here, making it one of the 51 sacred Shaktipeeths in India. The temple showcases striking Maratha architectural influences, evident from the towering deepstambhas (lamp pillars) that are beautifully lit during festivals. These tall lamp pillars, built by the Marathas, are rare architectural elements not commonly found in other Ujjain temples. Inside the sanctum, the idol of Harshidhhi Mata is flanked by idols of Annapurna and Mahalakshmi, forming a unique trinity of feminine power. A lesser-known fact is that the temple gained prominence during the reign of the Maratha rulers who renovated and elevated its status as a central shrine in Ujjain. The temple is located near the famous Mahakaleshwar Temple, forming a spiritual circuit for pilgrims visiting Ujjain. Local traditions include lighting 1,000 oil lamps on Amavasya (new moon) nights as an offering to the goddess. The peaceful courtyard and minimal commercialization around the temple create a serene spiritual experience for visitors. Beyond religion, the temple is a symbol of feminine strength and the region’s syncretic cultural heritage.",

        "text": "The Bharat Mata Temple in Ujjain offers a unique and thought-provoking experience, quite different from the typical temple visit. Instead of deities, this temple is dedicated to the personification of India as a mother goddess – Bharat Mata. Stepping inside, you're immediately struck by the imposing and intricately carved statue of Bharat Mata herself, holding a map of undivided India.\nThe atmosphere within is less about traditional religious fervor and more about patriotic reverence. It evokes a sense of national pride and historical awareness. The walls are adorned with depictions of significant figures and events from India's history, offering a visual journey through the nation's past. While it might not be a place for conventional worship, it serves as a powerful reminder of the country's rich heritage and the sacrifices made for its freedom.\nThe temple complex is generally well-maintained, and the serene environment allows for quiet contemplation. It's a place that encourages reflection on the unity and diversity of India. For those interested in history, culture, and a different perspective on national identity, the Bharat Mata Temple in Ujjain is definitely worth a visit. It provides a refreshing and meaningful experience beyond the usual pilgrimage.",

The ₹2100 pooja we performed was conducted very well by a knowledgeable pandit ji, who explained each step thoroughly.\n\nTo avoid traffic, it's best to take a right turn before entering Ujjain Gate. The temple also has a goshala, adding to its peaceful environment. While Pitra Pooja is done at Siddhvat, one should be mindful of charges, as poojas start from ₹100-200, but we ended up paying much more than needed.\n\nAngareshwar sees a huge crowd, and the pooja process moves quickly. As soon as one group completes their rituals, another takes their place. Even at the Shivling, multiple people perform pooja together, followed by another group almost instantly. While this rush is inevitable, it’s something to be aware of when visiting.\n\nDespite the crowd, the spiritual energy here is strong, making it a must-visit for those seeking relief from Mangal dosh and other obstacles.",

Over 100 divine stories of Lord Shiva unfold before your eyes, each a testament to ancient wisdom and artistic mastery. Walking amidst these depictions, chanting \"Jai Shree Mahakal,\" feels like traversing through the very legends of the cosmos, connecting deeply with the divine Leelas of Bholenath.\nThe 108 ornate sandstone columns, each adorned with the divine 'Trishul' and various 'mudras' of Lord Shiva, create an aura of reverence. The 192 statues and 53 murals further enhance this immersive experience, making the path to the main temple a visual and spiritual feast. One can't help but feel a palpable sense of peace and positive energy radiating from every corner.\nBeyond the aesthetic beauty, the corridor's thoughtful design facilitates a smoother darshan experience, even amidst large crowds. The seamless blend of divinity, comfort, and heritage preservation is truly commendable. The gentle sounds of temple bells, the murmuring of sacred chants, and the flowing Kshipra River nearby all contribute to a serene and tranquil atmosphere, making it a powerful preparatory journey for the ultimate devotion at the Mahakaleshwar Jyotirlinga.\nFor any devotee of Lord Shiva, the Mahakal Corridor is more than just an approach to the temple; it is an integral part of the spiritual odyssey. It allows one to absorb the essence of Mahakal, to reflect on His boundless glory, and to arrive at the sanctum sanctorum with a heart brimming with pure devotion. It is a testament to faith, a bridge to the divine, and an experience that truly nourishes the soul. A must-visit for every seeker of blessings and spiritual enlightenment.",

The ride was smooth, and the driver took the most efficient route, getting me to my selected tourist locations within time.\nPricing was reasonable and transparent—no surprise fees, which is a big plus.\n\nOverall, Mr Satya Soni delivered reliable, hassle-free service.

The request was served with good care, and I didn’t have to wait for long.\n\nIt's sad to see poor service from the Ujjain office staff (Mukesh Vishwakarma) as my application for a matured insurance policy payout got rejected, and when one of my relatives went to check on the status, he seemed to be busy and justified by stating that the signature did not match and hence got rejected. I live abroad and cannot come frequently to the branch to perform the KYC. When I asked, can you update my email or contact details which are incorrectly entered in the system. He said, \"This is not required as your insurance will be paid and it is not necessary\". Sadly, the staff is not trained enough to do all the due diligence and perform all the necessary checks at the time when the application is requested. I did a similar thing at ICICI Bank, and I received the payout in 3 working days.\n\nIt's hard to recommend anybody to go to Bajaj Alliance.",
