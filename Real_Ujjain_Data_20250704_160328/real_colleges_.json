All below is my perspective as a master student.\nTalking about infrastructure it's painful to to see your college in such a poor and horrible condition. However after present principal Dr. Umesh Pendharkar took over charges to his position the college got a nice paint job but you can still find gaps between walls and columns at various classrooms. Many computers still runs on pirated window. Only in this year mid 2017 they manage to buy softwares like Ansys , Staad pro., etc while they are conducting M.E. in computer aided structural design and drafting for over 10 years. Lab for geotech and transportation is quite average you can manage to do all the practicals but can't say the same about structure lab. College placement for civil students is like a ghost, never heard of any company came for civil engineers but for other branches like cs, ec, elec and chem. they got fair nos. of companies. Faculties here are no doubt very knowledgeable, but they don't have time and their teaching method is also very poor if you compare it with the teaching method of renowned professors from IIT like Dr. Pradipta Banerjee. In my experience of three semesters of M.E. with 13 academic subjects, only in 1 subject we got our complete syllabus covered and that subject too is taught by a guest faculty Maheshvari Sir. And when you move to your dissertation in fourth sem you find that no professor has any useful knowledge regarding softwares other than Staad pro. and Autocad. And they don't support creative and innovative thought, in my case I have been assigned to a guide who is PhD in Geotech while I'm a structure student. This college is surely very poor choice for doing master degree. However for B.E. in civil it's still an O.K. choice.\n\nIf you take admission using GATE score then they will make you work for the department consultancy , yeah you read it right the civil department here also run consultancy and master degree students are made to do most of the jobs like concrete design and testing otherwise they won't approve your attendance thus make you disqualify for that month's GATE stipend.\n\nIn case you don't have much money to spend on education then this college is good because fees is pretty less.",

The service and support from the staff is always there with you and they promote the ability of students through various activities.

It was our first batch and the infrastructure was limited.\n\nBut the faculty and the quality of teaching was high class. We used to have guest lectures by industry experts, as well as academicians from top intitutes like IIMs, XLRI and MDI.\n\nThe library had full compilations of HBR, literature by Peter Drucker and other management thoughtleaders. One never had to buy text books.\n\nAnd the beauty was, after the classes we used to gather at our professors' houses and kept discussing case studies and current news events.\n\nThat education gave me a solid foundation.\n\nAll our teachers from that time have soared high in the academic domain...Proud to say that we were taught by current VC of IGNOU, and a Director of IIM.",
