I had to literally ask for every basic thing one by one... No tissues, no spoon, no fork at table. Even when i asked for a finger bowl, they first said they don't provide it. But when another family asked for it, they gave it to them. When i mentioned the same that the other family got it, they gave me a finger bowl with cold water.\nHygiene: While having my food, one guy is sweeping in front of my table. Sweeping in an AC room while others are having dinner, No common sense at all.",

The rates of dishes are almost the same as compared to other restaurants. The taste is also good. Nowadays they have restructured their interiors, due to which if you're coming with a group of more than 6 people then you'll be congested.\n\nEarlier around 10 people can sit easily but now if someone comes with more than 6 people then it makes them really uncomfortable. In my recent visit, manchurian served was not good. Paneer tikka, sweet corn, hara kabab is good.",

While the rooftop isn’t very spacious, it accommodates around 40-50 people, making it ideal for small gatherings.\n\nThe food left me with mixed feelings. The starters were excellent, bursting with flavor, and undoubtedly the highlight of the meal. However, the main course—vegetable dishes and dal—was just average and didn’t quite match the expectations set by the starters.\n\nThe biggest drawback, unfortunately, was the service. It was noticeably slow, and the staff seemed inattentive despite multiple requests. This aspect could use significant improvement.\n\nOn the brighter side, the rooftop vibe was enjoyable and made the evening pleasant despite the slow service.",

On the brighter side, the Hakka noodles were excellent.\n\nThe atmosphere remains as chill and peaceful as ever. The café is beautifully designed—its logo, window area, and overall interior are aesthetically pleasing and thoughtfully done.\n\nAlthough this visit didn’t quite match up to previous ones, I still believe this place is a must-visit. It’s an iconic spot in Ujjain, and almost every Ujjainite has been here at least once.",
