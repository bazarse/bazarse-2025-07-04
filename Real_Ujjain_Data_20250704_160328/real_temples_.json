We drove 🚗 from Indore to Ujjain – a smooth 2-hour drive. Thankfully, we had already booked our entry tickets online 🎫. A helpful tip: make sure to carry a printout🖨️ of your entry pass, as mobile phones 📵 are not allowed inside the temple premises.\n\nThe darshan of the Jyotirlinga – the only south-facing Jyotirlinga – was a powerful and divine moment 🔥. It is believed that Lord Shiva manifested here as a pillar of fire, and standing there in the sanctum felt truly sacred 🙇‍♂️.\n\nAfter darshan, we took a walk through the temple corridor 🛕, which showcases beautiful stone statues 🗿 of Lord Shiva’s various incarnations. The whole area was clean, peaceful, and well-managed 👍.\n\nThere are proper arrangements to deposit your chappals/slippers 👡👞 near the temple entrance and clean drinking water 💧 is also available inside.\n\nHighly recommend every devotee of Lord Shiva 🕉️ to visit this sacred place at least once in their lifetime.\nHar Har Mahadev! 🙌🕉️",

Well managed, mainly the newly built Mahakal corridor and the facilities for devotees.  But lack of helpdesk or volunteer guidance. Bhasma Aarti, a unique early morning ritual, involving the offering of ashes to Mahakal. There will always be a rush however online boling is available including 'sheeghra darshan' at Rs. 250/- and many other Pujans. You can book for 'Rudrabhishek', dedicated Pandit will be assigned to do that. There is no specific dress code to enter the temple. Don't miss the 'Durlabh Darshan Kendra' at Mahakal corridor, a unique experience.",

        "text": "I recently visited this temple, what really caught my attention was the offering of liquor as prasad to the deity. 🤯\n\nThough there was a bit of a crowd but the waiting time was absolutely worth it. I also saw people tying sacred threads on the railings, praying for their wishes to come true.\n\nThe vibe was peaceful and the whole place felt spiritual.\n—————————-\nCurious to know more? Read below the full story 👇🏻\n\nWhere liquor is offered to deity as prasad, and no one knows where it goes!\n\nLocated on the banks of the river Shipra, in the middle of a Hindu cremation ground, Shree Kal Bhairav in Ujjain is a six-thousand-year-old temple. The temple is five kilometers away from the Mahakaleshwar Jyotirlinga. It is said that one’s visit to Ujjain is incomplete without a trip to this temple.\n\nSurprisingly, there are no dry days at the Kal Bhairav temple, as liquor is offered to the deity as prasad. The priest sitting in front of the deity pours liquor into a plate and places it near the deity's mouth while chanting mantras in Sanskrit and performing tantrik rituals. The plate is tilted slightly, and the liquid gradually begins to vanish. Within a couple of minutes, the god can consume as much as a quarter bottle, even though there is no visible opening in the deity’s mouth.\n\nThe liquor offered to the deity forms one of the five rituals of tantra – Madya (liquor), Mans (meat), Meen (fish), Mudra (gesture), and Maithun (copulation). Although several other deities across India receive alcohol as prasad, such as the Kali Mata temple in New Delhi and the Khabees Baba temple in Lucknow, only Kal Bhairav is supposed to possess the mysterious power of drinking liquor, and it remains a mystery where the liquid ends up.\n\nSeveral archaeologists and scientists have made multiple attempts to unveil this mystery. Even during the British period, the entire temple was excavated to determine if the liquid flowed into a cavity, but the mystery remained unresolved. Some claimed that the porous stone used to carve the deity could absorb alcohol, but this theory has been disproven. Others suggested that the alcohol evaporates into the atmosphere, but the rate at which the deity consumes the alcohol does not support this argument. Devotees believe that Lord Kaal Bhairav himself drinks the alcohol, and the prasad returned to the devotees is said to have healing powers that can cure various ailments.\n\nOutside the temple, liquor shops offer a variety of brands, where both men and women queue up to make their purchases. Hundreds of devotees visit the temple daily, some as pilgrims and others out of curiosity. The temple complex houses a Deepstambh adorned with oil lamps lit on special occasions.",

Had visited the temple on an auspicious weekend and the waiting queue was almost 1.5 hours but the crowd was very well managed and moved faster than expected. There are plenty of shops and 2 liquor stores outside this temple where you could buy the Aarati thali and other puja essentials.\n\nThe crazy part is there will be children selling water bottles by sitting on the dividers of the standing queue where you can buy water if you don’t have one!\n\nTip- If you’re visiting for the first time and in the day time, do carry a cap or dupatta to cover your head as it’s very sunny during the summers and you’ve to wait in a long queue if there’s rush.",

Located close to the famous Mahakaleshwar Temple, it is dedicated to Goddess Harsiddhi, an incarnation of Goddess Durga. The temple holds significant religious importance and is believed to be the spot where Goddess Sati’s elbow fell, making it a powerful spiritual site for devotees.\n\nThe architecture of the temple reflects the Maratha style, with its striking red tower (shikhara) and intricately carved structures. The presence of the Sri Yantra, symbolizing divine feminine energy, and an ancient well within the premises adds to its historical and mystical appeal. The temple is especially famous for its two majestic deepstambhas (lamp pillars), which are lit with hundreds of oil lamps during evening aarti, creating a divine and captivating ambiance.\n\nVisitors often describe the experience as spiritually uplifting, especially during Navratri when the temple is beautifully decorated and crowded with devotees. The temple is well-maintained, easily accessible, and offers a peaceful atmosphere despite its popularity. Whether you're a devotee or a traveler interested in cultural heritage, Harsiddhi Temple offers a memorable and soul-stirring experience.",

It is believed that the elbow of Goddess Sati fell here, making it one of the 51 sacred Shaktipeeths in India. The temple showcases striking Maratha architectural influences, evident from the towering deepstambhas (lamp pillars) that are beautifully lit during festivals. These tall lamp pillars, built by the Marathas, are rare architectural elements not commonly found in other Ujjain temples. Inside the sanctum, the idol of Harshidhhi Mata is flanked by idols of Annapurna and Mahalakshmi, forming a unique trinity of feminine power. A lesser-known fact is that the temple gained prominence during the reign of the Maratha rulers who renovated and elevated its status as a central shrine in Ujjain. The temple is located near the famous Mahakaleshwar Temple, forming a spiritual circuit for pilgrims visiting Ujjain. Local traditions include lighting 1,000 oil lamps on Amavasya (new moon) nights as an offering to the goddess. The peaceful courtyard and minimal commercialization around the temple create a serene spiritual experience for visitors. Beyond religion, the temple is a symbol of feminine strength and the region’s syncretic cultural heritage.",

        "text": "The Bharat Mata Temple in Ujjain offers a unique and thought-provoking experience, quite different from the typical temple visit. Instead of deities, this temple is dedicated to the personification of India as a mother goddess – Bharat Mata. Stepping inside, you're immediately struck by the imposing and intricately carved statue of Bharat Mata herself, holding a map of undivided India.\nThe atmosphere within is less about traditional religious fervor and more about patriotic reverence. It evokes a sense of national pride and historical awareness. The walls are adorned with depictions of significant figures and events from India's history, offering a visual journey through the nation's past. While it might not be a place for conventional worship, it serves as a powerful reminder of the country's rich heritage and the sacrifices made for its freedom.\nThe temple complex is generally well-maintained, and the serene environment allows for quiet contemplation. It's a place that encourages reflection on the unity and diversity of India. For those interested in history, culture, and a different perspective on national identity, the Bharat Mata Temple in Ujjain is definitely worth a visit. It provides a refreshing and meaningful experience beyond the usual pilgrimage.",

The ₹2100 pooja we performed was conducted very well by a knowledgeable pandit ji, who explained each step thoroughly.\n\nTo avoid traffic, it's best to take a right turn before entering Ujjain Gate. The temple also has a goshala, adding to its peaceful environment. While Pitra Pooja is done at Siddhvat, one should be mindful of charges, as poojas start from ₹100-200, but we ended up paying much more than needed.\n\nAngareshwar sees a huge crowd, and the pooja process moves quickly. As soon as one group completes their rituals, another takes their place. Even at the Shivling, multiple people perform pooja together, followed by another group almost instantly. While this rush is inevitable, it’s something to be aware of when visiting.\n\nDespite the crowd, the spiritual energy here is strong, making it a must-visit for those seeking relief from Mangal dosh and other obstacles.",

This magnificent expansion truly elevates the devotional experience, preparing the mind and soul for the divine presence of Lord Shiva.\nFrom the moment you enter through the grand Nandi Dwar or Pinaki Dwar, a sense of sacredness envelops you. The sprawling pathways, meticulously designed and well-lit, guide devotees with grace, allowing for a comfortable and immersive journey. What truly sets this corridor apart is the breathtaking array of intricately carved sculptures. Over 100 divine stories of Lord Shiva unfold before your eyes, each a testament to ancient wisdom and artistic mastery. Walking amidst these depictions, chanting \"Jai Shree Mahakal,\" feels like traversing through the very legends of the cosmos, connecting deeply with the divine Leelas of Bholenath.\nThe 108 ornate sandstone columns, each adorned with the divine 'Trishul' and various 'mudras' of Lord Shiva, create an aura of reverence. The 192 statues and 53 murals further enhance this immersive experience, making the path to the main temple a visual and spiritual feast. One can't help but feel a palpable sense of peace and positive energy radiating from every corner.\nBeyond the aesthetic beauty, the corridor's thoughtful design facilitates a smoother darshan experience, even amidst large crowds. The seamless blend of divinity, comfort, and heritage preservation is truly commendable. The gentle sounds of temple bells, the murmuring of sacred chants, and the flowing Kshipra River nearby all contribute to a serene and tranquil atmosphere, making it a powerful preparatory journey for the ultimate devotion at the Mahakaleshwar Jyotirlinga.\nFor any devotee of Lord Shiva, the Mahakal Corridor is more than just an approach to the temple; it is an integral part of the spiritual odyssey. It allows one to absorb the essence of Mahakal, to reflect on His boundless glory, and to arrive at the sanctum sanctorum with a heart brimming with pure devotion. It is a testament to faith, a bridge to the divine, and an experience that truly nourishes the soul. A must-visit for every seeker of blessings and spiritual enlightenment.",
