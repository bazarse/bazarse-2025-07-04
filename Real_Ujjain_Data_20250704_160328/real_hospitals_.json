However, I have very bad experience with the most of the nurse staff(Private room) handling my mother case on day to day basis. Most of the nurses are either trainee or they simply dont have been taught how to talk or respond with respect. Following points shows their insensitivity:\n1. Whenever asked abt the patients BP value range being taken, they simply try to ignore first. Then being asked again, they still will not tell the range. Does the kin of patient dont have right to ask this basic info.to know the current status of patient health??\n2. They come to room and ask the kin of the patient to give the 4-5 different tablets at certain interval during the day..my straight forward question here is if mistakenly by fault the kin gives overdose of some tablet or forget to give one..who should be held responsible for this???\n3. Some of the nurse staff give arrogant (rude) answers & looks to any query being asked regarding the patient health in polite manner. If one is properly educated & in nursing profession then how one should respond to a polite question??? It was very frustating many a times for me to bear their rudeness...what if I could also have done the same in response to their rude answers leaving aside my politeness???? But I have kept patience till last...\n4. A nurse forgotten to give saline scheduled during the day time..so she literally came at midnight(12 pm)saying she has missed it during the day and now will put on the saline...How one can forget it???? Do patient has no right to sleep in night after so many doses, saline and injection during the day??\n5. When Saline are being put..ideally it is duty of nursing staff to come and check if the saline is complete or not( to avoid air or blood from veins getting up)...but all the time..myself have to monitor it and press the bell button which toobwas on extreme corner of room.\n6. The response time after pressing the bell was very slow..one has to press the bell button a couple of times for someone to come and attend the case when needed. Most of time, nurses were busy chit-chatting in their main room.\n7. The medicine prescribed by doctor or the bill to be paid for any test downatairs during the course of the day should be either given in one go or atleast a couple of times...it happened like I had to go downstairs at the billing or medicine section 4-5 times leaving behind the patient...who will take care of the patient if the kin is being told many times to go downstairs...why not only a couple of times????\n\nNursing profession is very caring and kind profession in which admitted patient is being treated very kindly. It is absolutely unacceptable if the caring staff displays rude gesture and talk like they are the bosses, even if they are confronting a polite individual. \"WHAT IS TRUTH REMAINS  A TRUTH \" and the god has seen that there..whatever I have said is what I have experienced, no doubt about it, even my review is not taken seriously. But ignoring it will simply malign the image of the hospital as this will happen again and again to someone in near future. The nursing staff must be given thorough training first and foremost on \"How to behave or respond in polite manner\".\nFew nurses were kind and polite in answering, but some seemed filled with arrogance & lack of mannerism.\nIts upto management of Pushpa mission to understand the gravity of situation. Ignore or respond and please take steps to train nurses to speak in polite kind way and not to throw their responsibilities on kin staying with the patient. My mother had been admitted to Room no. 219",

They do things on their own pace no matter what u say.\n\n- ICU ward is no better than a general ward.\n\n- Nurses, ward boys, on-call doctors and even the housekeeping staff thinks of themselves as some sort of royalty, extremely arrogant, slow, unprofessional behavior. Don't even know how to talk to patients or even to each other for that matter.\n\n- Ambulance driver will talk on phone while driving a patient and when u go complaining about it,the receptionist will say that it's fine they can receive calls while driving sometimes.\n\n- Cleanliness and hygiene is pathetic.",

Asked to hospital staff for the cameras to check . The biggest surprise, this hospital doesn't have security cameras at the entrance. So if anything happens at the entrance, hospital won't be liable bcz there will be no proof. So definitely going here is at own risk. Definitely I won't suggest this hospital and also they won't accept online payments at the reception. We have to go to there pharmacy pay online there nd thn they will give cash to u than that u hve to give to reception. Ridiculous working.",
