Even before that, the cooling was poor. We had to call and complain to get it fixed, which disrupted our rest.\n\nWhat made things worse was the attitude of the staff. At checkout, no one acknowledged our inconvenience. The manager had no idea about the issue, and the front desk staff were indifferent—as if handling complaints with silence is part of their daily routine. Not even a basic apology was offered.\n\nWe checked in late (around 10 PM) and left after breakfast. All we wanted was a peaceful night’s sleep, but even that wasn’t delivered. Definitely not the experience you expect from a resort of this standard.",

        "text": "I am writing to express my deep disappointment with my recent experience at this property (Rudraksh Resort Ujjain). Unfortunately, my stay was far from the standard one would expect from a hospitality establishment, especially one charging premium rates.\n\nMy experience began at the reception, where I arrived at approximately 10:30 PM, hoping to find a reasonable deal for a short stay—less than 12 hours, as I planned to check out the next morning. However, I was informed that the entire resort was sold out and that even if rooms were available, they would be charged at a non-negotiable rate of ₹8,000. I was also told that staff had been instructed to sell rooms at escalated prices. I found the tone and manner in which this was communicated quite unwelcoming and lacking the courtesy expected in the hospitality industry.\n\nSubsequently, I booked a room online through Cleartrip for ₹6,500—a Superior Room. Upon returning to the property, I was told the room I booked was not available and that I had been \"upgraded\" to a Superior Deluxe Room. While I initially appreciated the gesture, the upgraded room was in a poor and unacceptable condition—unclean and poorly maintained. I immediately requested to be placed in the room I originally booked.\n\nEventually, I was allotted the original category, but the room did not match the images shown online. It lacked basic amenities like bedside lamps and looked significantly different from the photos, which I was told \"may be outdated.\" It was clear to me, however, that the pictures online were recent and more flattering than the reality.\n\nI raised the issue again with a senior staff member, who then offered another upgrade to an Executive Room. By this time, it was around 11:15 PM, and I was extremely fatigued from the entire ordeal. The Executive Room, too, was disappointing. It appeared old and worn-out—the furniture was stained and had hair from a previous guest, the toilet was not properly cleaned, and overall cleanliness and quality of the room were far below acceptable standards. I have photographic evidence to support these claims.\n\nGiven the premium pricing, I strongly believe that basic standards of hygiene, maintenance, and service should be upheld. Unfortunately, that was not the case.\n\nLater that night, I visited their cafe, which I was informed operates until 2:00 AM. I ordered Hakka noodles and a classic veg pizza. The noodles were average, but the pizza—after a 20-minute wait—was served with an overwhelming amount of mozzarella cheese, making it inedible. When I requested to cancel the pizza, I was told it could not be canceled and could only be remade. At that point, given everything that had already transpired, I had no desire to wait another 20 minutes. After a prolonged and frustrating conversation involving multiple staff members, the item was eventually canceled.\n\nOverall, this was one of the worst hospitality experiences I have encountered. The quality of the rooms, lack of cleanliness, and dismissive customer service are not reflective of the standards expected from a resort of your repute. I would not recommend this property to others unless significant improvements are made in both quality and service delivery.",

This is Dharmshala and not resort.\n\nThe hotel was advertised as a 4-star property, but the reality was far from it like Dharmshala. The condition of the hotel was extremely poor—more comparable to a 1-star establishment. The rooms were inadequately maintained, unhygienic, and had a persistent foul smell. Basic amenities were missing:\nNo room service or in-house restaurant\nNo refrigerator in the room or anywhere on the property\nNo complimentary drinking water provided\nThe swimming pool was dirty.\nThe parking facility was inconveniently located 1 km away from the hotel\nAdditionally, the washrooms were unclean and the premises lacked regular housekeeping.\nThis experience was extremely disappointing and not aligned with what was promised at the time of booking.",

The food was delicious, with a great variety of options for all tastes.\n\nThe hotel’s location is perfect, with easy access to nearby attractions and public transport.\n\nOverall, I had a fantastic stay at Hotel Shree Ram and would highly recommend it to anyone visiting the area.

I specifically requested that my room be made ready by then and that my luggage be placed in the room, so that everything would be in order when I returned and there would be no inconvenience.\n\nWhen I came back at 12:15 AM, only one room was ready, and the second AC deluxe room was neither ready nor did anyone seem aware of it. The night staff said that the morning staff didn’t inform them, and in the morning, when I brought it up, I was told that the night staff should have handled it.\n\nSecondly, there was no tea/coffee maker in the room, even though it was mentioned as a facility in the AC deluxe room. The price difference between the two rooms was quite significant, but both rooms looked the same from the inside—so what was the benefit of paying more?\n\nIn the kitchen, there was only one staff member cooking and one steward delivering the food. The service was extremely slow. This place needs a lot of improvement so that such a beautiful property, located at such a prime location, can be utilized to its full potential.\n\nIt seems that because this is a government property, the staff is not paying proper attention to service and maintenance.",

Inside, the ambiance is equally impressive—calm, clean, and welcoming.\n\nModak Restaurant, located within the premises, offers delicious meals with great service. The staff is courteous and attentive, making sure every guest feels taken care of.\n\nOverall, Atharva is a fantastic place to stay or host events.
